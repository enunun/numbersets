# The `numbersets` Package

## Overview

The `numbersets` package allows users to express mathematical concepts related to sets of numbers
using meaningful commands rather than relying on visual representations.

For example, using `\RealNumbers` clearly indicates the intention of denoting the set of all real numbers, 
while `\mathbb{R}` focuses solely on the formatting without conveying the underlying concept.
Therefore, using `\RealNumbers` is preferable because it provides more context and meaning. 

### Key Features:
- Command to specify typefaces for number sets.
- Interface for defining typeface rules.
- Interface for creating commands that represent number sets.
- Several predefined presets for common number sets.
